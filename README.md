Watcher follows a GitOps approach for infrastructure management using the [**watcher-infra**](https://github.com/biskitsx/watcher-infra) repository. This repository is responsible for automating deployments, managing infrastructure as code, and ensuring consistency across environments. By leveraging **GitOps**nciples, Watcher benefits from:
- **Automated Deployments**: Continuous integration and deployment pipelines ensure smooth updates.
- **Version Control for Infrastructure**: All changes are tracked and auditable.
- **Scalability and Reliability**: Infrastructure is managed declaratively, making scaling and maintenance easier.

The **watcher-infra** repository integrates with CI/CD tools to automatically deploy changes whenever updates are pushed, ensuring a stable and efficient development workflow.

## Infrastructure

The Watcher application is hosted on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** using a robust and scalable architecture:
- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Ensures a secure and isolated environment.
- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Cluster**: Hosts the application and manages containerized workloads.
- **Compute Engine**: Used for additional backend services within a private subnet.
- **Load Balancing & Nginx Ingress**: Handles incoming traffic efficiently.
- **Cloud Firewall Rules**: Secures the application by controlling network traffic.
- **Cloud NAT**: Allows secure outbound connections to third-party APIs and container registries.

This architecture ensures high availability, security, and scalability for the Watcher application.
